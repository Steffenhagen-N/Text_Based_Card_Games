# Text Based Card Games

This project is meant to be an exercise in Object Oriented Programming, and creating extensible programs. The main.py file is the basic framework that additional game files use. Ideally, it shouldn't need to be changed much, if at all, in order to implement additional card games.


Card Game program designed to have an iterative framework that allows for additional games to be added in the future
Personal project to practice OOP and multi-file projects
